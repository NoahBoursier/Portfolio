                                        There are two middle schools that feed into one highschool in my hometown, one middle school is on the east side, where there are a bunch of chinese and indian immagrants, and the west side, which is more of a mix. I went to Wells Middle School, on the west side of town, where academics aren't nearly as stressed as in the east at Fallon Middle School. There wasn't any pressure to get ahead in math, or participate in clubs, or any advertisement for the high school robotics team. I was in a tight knit clique of just two other friends but we were probably the most passionate about building with electronics and whatever else we could find out of our entire class. When we went to the highschool we found that we were the only students from Wells who were joining robotics, and that I was the only white studnet in robotics, this didn't bother me at all, I thought it was fun to be a 'minority'.

                                        In robotics my friends and I from the west all rose to high positions in the club, easy out performing those from the east who only participated in order to put an extracurricular activity on their college app. I became a builder, though I am capable of writing code I decided that I would rather spend my time working with my hands on the robot. I often led groups of other students in the assembly of robots and their componenets. I would spend hours a day, often every day of the week, in robotics. I just love to see a well made machine.

                                        My highschool robotics club has a development team where students new to engineering or using Vex cna develope their skills beofre joining a competition team. I would often help teach for this group, covering topics such as gear ratios to the uses of simple machines like levers and linkages.

                                        My highschool robotics team (number 5327) partcipates in the international Vex Robotics Competition. Our school has 5 teams every year, four competition teams and one 'dev' or development team which is where newcomers to the club can learn the basics of Vex, programming, wiring, and simple machines. I have been on two different teams from my highschool: 5327W, which went to state and then world championships, winning multiple awards, and 5327C, which went to state championships and won multiple excellence awards - the highest award that can be recieved at a competition.

                                        The machine sorts the marbles differentiating between wood, plastic, and metal by first testing to see if they interrupt light. 
                                        To do this, we have a light sensor that is opposite the flashlight, and when the marble is stopped by the servo gate in between 
                                        the two, it will either interrupt the light and give our sensor a higher value or, if it is plastic, give us a lower value, because the 
                                        light is not interrupted. Then, depending on whether the marble is opaque or not, we can tell if it is plastic or not, if it is 
                                        plastic, it is dropped into the first bin. To differentiate between metal and wood, we first have the bin conveyor 
                                        belt, which utilizes a VEX 393 motor, to move the second (wood) bin into the drop position. The servo gate will then release the marble which is either wood or 
                                        metal at this point. If the marble is wood, it will simply fall through into the wood bin, however if it is metal, the electromagnet 
                                        will be on, catching and holding it as the bin conveyor positions the metal bin below. Once the metal bin is below, the electromagnet 
                                        will turn off, releasing the metal marble into the metal bin. After this process, the bins will return to starting position 
                                        where the process can be repeated.

                                        The final project in my sophomore engineering class was to construct a machine using Vex and FisherTech parts that would sort three different types of marbles into their respective containers. Because the marbles were clear plastic, wood and metal, we used an electromagnet, light sensor and flashlight to tell them apart from each other.
                                    </p>
                                    <p  class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay=".5s" data-wow-duration="500ms">
                                        Our final design was intended to include the ability to sort as many as 20 or more marbles without human interaction. However, 
                                        due to issues that needed to be solved before the presentation date that were more pressing, we were unable to finish the feeding 
                                        trough. Our design uses a button, light sensor, flashlight, servo motor, 393 motor, and a Fisher Tech electromagnet. To operate 
                                        our machine, a user must simply place a marble on the intake ramp, and press the button to begin the process. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p  class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay=".7s" data-wow-duration="500ms">
                                        The machine sorts the marbles differentiating between wood, plastic, and metal by first testing to see if they interrupt light. 
                                        To do this, we have a light sensor that is opposite the flashlight, and when the marble is stopped by the servo gate in between 
                                        the two, it will either interrupt the light and give our sensor a higher value or, if it is plastic, give us a lower value, because the 
                                        light is not interrupted. Then, depending on whether the marble is opaque or not, we can tell if it is plastic or not, if it is 
                                        plastic, it is dropped into the first bin. To differentiate between metal and wood, we first have the bin conveyor 
                                        belt, which utilizes a VEX 393 motor, to move the second (wood) bin into the drop position. The servo gate will then release the marble which is either wood or 
                                        metal at this point. If the marble is wood, it will simply fall through into the wood bin, however if it is metal, the electromagnet 
                                        will be on, catching and holding it as the bin conveyor positions the metal bin below. Once the metal bin is below, the electromagnet 
                                        will turn off, releasing the metal marble into the metal bin. After this process, the bins will return to starting position 
                                        where the process can be repeated.
